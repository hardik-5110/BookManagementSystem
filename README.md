# LibraryManagementSystem

**Overview**
The Library Management System is a Python-based application that allows for managing a collection of books in a library. The system provides functionality to add, issue, return, and display books, helping to track their availability and the details of borrowers. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts in Python and offers a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the library.

**Features**
**Add New Books:** Add books to the library with details such as title, author, and ISBN.
**Issue Books:** Issue a book to a borrower, preventing it from being issued to anyone else until it is returned.
**Return Books:** Return a book and make it available for others to borrow.
**Display Available Books:** List all books that are currently available for borrowing.
**Display Issued Books:** List all books that are currently issued, along with the borrower's name.

**How It Works**
The system is divided into two main components:

**Book Class:** Represents a single book with details such as title, author, ISBN, and borrower information.
**Library Class:** Manages the collection of books, handling the operations like adding books, issuing, and returning them.

Users interact with the system through a command-line interface that provides the following options:

Add a book to the library.
Issue a book to a borrower.
Return a book.
Display available books.
Display issued books.
Exit the system.
